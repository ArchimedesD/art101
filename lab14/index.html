                <p>I debugged lab 3 - File Structures. The problem was the image of my file structure wasn't showing up so there was no visual of what I was doing. 
                    This was because the link for the image I was using was going to the write directory. 
                    Ironiccally, the file structure was incorrect. To fix this, I just used a different image and made sure to check that the directory was correct.</p>
