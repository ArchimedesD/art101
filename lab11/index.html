			<h1>Lab 11 - JavaScript Events and Forms</h1>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge for this lab was to use JavaScript events and forms to create a button that outputs a randomized version of the user's input.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I had problems having my button print the right output. It would print a randomized version of the input word that didn't contain all of its letters.
                         There were also times where my button just didn't print anything at all.
                          I had to have my roommate, who is experienced with JavaScript, to check my code and help with what I did wrong. 
                          I also used chatGPT to help with specific parts of my code.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>There's a text prompt below. Write something and click the button next to it.</p>
			</div>

            <div id="output"></div>

            <input type="text" id="user-name" placeholder="Input text here">

            <button id="submit">Randomize!</button>
