			<h1>Lab 9 - Libraries & jQuery</h1>

			<div id="challenge" class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge for this lab was to experiment with jQuery by creating buttons that change the site's appearence upon clicking them.</p>
					<button id="button-challenge">CLICK ME!</button>
			</div>

			<div id="problems" class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Problems arose in both HTML and JavaScript. In HTML, I didn't realize that I needed to create div ids for each section. 
						This caused my JS code to call onto nothing when refrencing HTML. This meant there were no buttons at all on the page leaving me confused and frustrated.
						 Once I realized this, it made everything make sense causing no problems later on.</p>
					<button id="button-problems">CLICK ME AGAIN!</button>
			</div>

			<div id="results" class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>The results are these awesome buttons that are begging to be clicked.</p>
					<div id="output"></div>
					<button id="button-results">ONE MORE TIME!</button>
