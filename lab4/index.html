			<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocode</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>This lab involved brainstorming a list of tasks and breaking them down into sub-tasks. 
						We then rewrote these steps in the form of pseudocode and implemented them into the comments of a javascript file.
						 This challenge was to have us think in terms of pseudocode when coding.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>The problem I faced was trying to think in terms of psuedocode. 
						It felt unusual to talk about everyday tasks or games and break them down in coding terms.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>Our result is a list of pseudocode detailing the implementation of Snake Game.</p>
