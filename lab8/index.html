			<h1>Lab 8 - Anon Fuctions & Callbacks</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge for this lab was to experiment with anonymous functions and callbacks to output an array of numbers calculated using certain parameters.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I struggled with figuring out the output for this lab. I realized too late that the results would appear in the console rather than the page itself. 
                        I realize now how obvious that is due to the fact that we used console.log rather than document.writeln. However, Even when I figured that out, I still had trouble debugging my code.
                    </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>The result is in the console. It shows three arrays titled: My array, Mapped numbers and Results.</p>
					<div id="output"></div>
