			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The aim for this lab was to create a function that takes in user input as a string and outputs an altered version of that string.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I had problems using the correct syntax in order for my function to work. 
						This lab has made me realize how important correct syntax is and how easily your code can go down a different road when having a simple spelling error.
						I had problems with my window prompt command popping up more than once and had to deeply analyze the syntax of my code as well as where my files were being directed to.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>The result is a window prompt that asks for the user's name. When entered, the page outputs a manipulated version of that name. This can be seen below.</p>
					<div id="output"></div>
